description: Bosch m_can CAN-FD controller

compatible: "st,stm32-fdcan"

include: bosch-mcan.yaml

properties:
    pinctrl-0:
      type: phandles
      required: false
      description: |
        GPIO pin configuration for CAN signals (RX, TX). We expect
        that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.

        For example the can1 would be
           pinctrl-0 = <&fdcan1_rx_pa11 &fdcan1_tx_pa12>;

    shared-irq-names:
        type: string-array
        required: false
        description: |
          Name of each shared-irq in shared-irqs.
          Required if shared-irqs are used.

    shared-irqs:
        type: phandle-array
        required: false
        description: |
          To avoid interrupt conflicts shared-irq nodes can be referenced.
          When shared-irqs are defined with matching names,
          the driver registers the isr in the shared-irq driver instead of
          connecting to the interrupt defined in the interrupts array.

          example overlay for stm32g0b1

          &shared_irq21: {
              status = "okay";
          };

          &shared_irq22 {
              status = "okay";
          };

          &can1 {
              shared-irqs = <&shared_irq21 &shared_irq22>;
              shared-irq-names = "LINE_0", "LINE_1";
          };

          &can2 {
              shared-irqs = <&shared_irq21 &shared_irq22>;
              shared-irq-names = "LINE_0", "LINE_1";
          };
