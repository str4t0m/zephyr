      required: true

      required: true

    shared-irq:
        type: phandle
        required: false
        description: |
          In case of interrupt conflict a shared interrupt controller can
          be specified which dispaches to all consumers.
          When the shared-irq phandle is defined, it will be automatically
          used insted of the direct interrupt defined in interrupts
          property.

    parity:
      required: false
      type: int
      description: |
        Configures the parity of the adapter. Value 0 for none, 1 for odd
        and 2 for even parity.  Default to none if not specified.

    pinctrl-0:
      type: phandles
      required: false
      description: |
        GPIO pin configuration for serial signals (RX, TX, RTS, CTS).  We expect
        that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.

        For example the USART1 would be
           pinctrl-0 = <&usart1_tx_pb6 &usart1_rx_pb7>;
